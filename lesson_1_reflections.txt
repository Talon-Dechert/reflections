How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By showing only the different lines and therefore what might have caused a change in other lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By seeing each change as it evolved

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing allows you to better keep track of intended changes, where automatic will make sure, in the event of an accident, your files are up to date

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows for changes to an entire program, Google Docs focus on each file independently

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log will show you the files that were updated, diff will show you the differences in said files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By purposely separating the experimental changes you push through, you're allowing yourself to easily be able to find the unintended consequences via git diff and git log

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Still a alot to experiment with, mostly easy navigation of files
